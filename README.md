[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/596085396.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/596085396)

This repository provides the source code of "Distillation from Heterogeneous Models for Top-K Recommendation" accepted in TheWebConf (WWW2023) as a research paper.


### 1. Overview
We present HetComp Framework that effectively compresses the valuable but difficult ensemble knowledge of heterogeneous models, generating a lightweight model with high recommendation performance.

### 2. Main Results
Training curves of w/o KD, DCD, and HetComp. Testing recall per 10 epochs. After convergence, we plot the last value.

We found that the sampling processes for top-ranked unobserved items are unnecessary, and removing the processes gave considerable performance improvements for the ranking matching KD methods (i.e., RRD, MTD, CL-DRD, and DCD). For this reason, we remove the sampling process for all ranking matching methods in our experiments. 


### 3. Requirements
#### 3-a. Dataset
- A-music dataset can be downloaded from: http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/
- CiteULike dataset can be downloaded from: https://github.com/js05212/citeulike-t/blob/master/users.dat
- Foursquare dataset can be downloaded from: https://github.com/allenjack/SAE-NAD
#### 3-b. Software
- Python version: 3.6.10
- Pytorch version: 1.10.1
#### 3-c. Else.
- The target teacher models and their trajectories need to be located in Teachers directory.
- Due to its large size, we will provide pretrained teacher trajectories through another file-sharing system.
